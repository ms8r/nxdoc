Navigatrix - What Is It And Why Do I Need It?
=============================================

Navigatrix is a complete operating system for your computer. It is put
together by people on boats for people on boats. Navigatrix includes a
compilation of electronic tools for navigation, communication,
information and security that you can use offshore, on shore, or at
anchor. It is simple and lightweight and based on the best Debian/Ubuntu
has to offer. It is the fastest, most efficient, and versatile Linux
distribution for cruisers and navigators available.

Navigatrix is nearly indestructible running on a 4 gigabyte, or larger,
USB stick or SD card. It allows access to your hard drive data if you
choose, and even works if your hard drive doesn't. Navigatrix can also
be installed on your hard drive for increased speed and versatility.
Installed on the hard drive it works on almost any personal computer
built in the last 12 years.

Why do I need Navigatrix? Many reasons - here are a few:

-  The Navigatrix distribution is pre-configured with a set of software
   tools that work out of the box. It is set up for energy efficiency
   and ease of use. It's not flashy but it is extremely stable.
   Navigatrix follows a best practice policy. It might not have the
   latest version of a particular application, or mouth watering
   eye-candy, but what it does have works and, more importantly, works
   in the system with other applications and across a wide variety of
   hardware out of the box.

-  It is very light-weight and will typically boot and run significantly
   faster than for example Microsoft Windows, especially on older
   laptops and/or netbooks commonly found on cruising boats.

-  It has what it needs “out of the box”. There is no need to download
   patches and updates. This is a key advantage if you are sailing in
   waters with only rudimentary communications infrastructure (e. g.
   most of the tropics). In many cruising destinations bandwidth is too
   sparse to waste it on downloading the latest 20 MB of security
   updates and bug-fixes every time you finally get to a wifi
   connection.

-  You can run the entire system from a USB stick. This reduces the risk
   of hard drive damage on a moving boat. It also allows you to run it
   on any computer on board or onshore (e.g. in case of equipment
   failure).

-  It is truly configured for use on a boat. It has, for example, some
   smart GPS interfacing that keeps applications configuration files
   updated with your latest position and also keeps your system clock
   honest.

-  It has a very helpful support discussion board and a rapidly growing
   user community.
