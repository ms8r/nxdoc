 <h1 id="sec_nx_what_and_why"></a>Navigatrix - what is it and why do I need it?</h1>

 <p>﻿Navigatrix is a complete operating system for your computer. It is put together by people on boats for people on boats. Navigatrix includes a compilation of electronic tools for navigation, communication, information and security that you can use offshore, on shore, or at anchor. It is simple and lightweight and based on the best Debian/Ubuntu has to offer. It is the fastest, most efficient, and versatile Linux distribution for cruisers and navigators available.</p>

 <p>Navigatrix is nearly indestructible running on a 4 gigabyte, or larger, USB stick or SD card. It allows access to your hard drive data if you choose, and even works if your hard drive doesn't. Navigatrix can also be installed on your hard drive for increased speed and versatility. Installed on the hard drive it works on almost any personal computer built in the last 12 years.</p>

 <p>Why do I need Navigatrix? Many reasons - here are a few:</p>

 <ul>
 <li> The Navigatrix distribution is pre-configured with a set of software tools that work out of the box. It is set up for energy efficiency and ease of use. It's not flashy but it is extremely stable. Navigatrix follows a best practice policy. It might not have the latest version of a particular application, or mouth watering eye-candy, but what it does have works and, more importantly, works in the system with other applications and across a wide variety of hardware out of the box.</li>
 <li>It is very light-weight and will typically boot and run significantly faster than for example Microsoft Windows, especially on older laptops and/or netbooks commonly found on cruising boats.</li>
 <li>It has what it needs &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. There is no need to download patches and updates. This is a key advantage if you are sailing in waters with only rudimentary communications infrastructure (e. g. most of the tropics). In many cruising destinations bandwidth is too sparse to waste it on downloading the latest 20 MB of security updates and bug-fixes every time you finally get to a wifi connection.</li>
 <li>You can run the entire system from a USB stick. This reduces the risk of hard drive damage on a moving boat. It also allows you to run it on any computer on board or onshore (e.g. in case of equipment failure).</li>
 <li>It is truly configured for use on a boat. It has, for example, some smart GPS interfacing that keeps applications configuration files updated with your latest position and also keeps your system clock honest.</li>
 <li>It has a very helpful support discussion board and a rapidly growing user community.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Go ahead and try it!</p>

   <p>﻿Navigatrix is a complete operating system for your computer. It is put together by people on boats for people on boats. Navigatrix is a compilation of electronic tools for navigation, communication, information and security that you can use offshore, on shore, or at anchor. It is simple and lightweight and based on the latest Debian/Ubuntu has to offer.</p>

   <p>Navigatrix is the fastest, most efficient, and versatile Linux distribution for cruisers and navigators available. It is assembled and configured for people who float...for people who sail across the Pacific; sit at anchor off somewhere; or load up their computer, walk 2ks to an internet café to send/receive emails and get the latest weather and news.</p>

   <p>The Navigatrix distribution is pre-configured with a set of software tools that work out of the box. It's pre-configured for energy efficiency and ease of use. It's not flashy. It's stable. It is extremely stable. A couple of applications can't rub their belly and pat their head at the same time and will crash if pushed, but it is trivial....occasionally irritating, but trivial. The core of essential navigation and communication tools, however, is extremely stable.</p>

   <p>Frequently the latest and greatest version of a particular application is released as stable. Two months later a bug is found...a month later a new-improved version is released...but doesn't play well with the other children, or the other children don't play with it. If that release is an entire operating system the problems will drive you mad. It's like an ecosystem where changes in one place may alter the viability of another.</p>

   <p>Navigatrix follows a best practice policy. It might not have the latest version of a particular application, or mouth watering eye-candy, but what it does have works and, more importantly, works in the system with other applications and across a wide variety of hardware out of the box.</p>
