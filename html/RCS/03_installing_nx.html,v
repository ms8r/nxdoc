 <h1 id="sec_installing_nx">Installing Navigatrix</h1>

 <p><em>*** NOTE: the instructions and screenshots below refer Navigatrix version 0.5 (ISO downloaded in or after July 2013). For instructions to install the earlier 0.4 version of Navigatrix please see <a href="03_installing_nx04.html">here</a>. ***</em>

 <p> This section explains how to install Navigatrix from a bootable USB stick, SD card or DVD as well as configuring Navigatrix for different languages.</p>

 <h2>Installing Navigatrix onto the Hard Disk</h2>

 <p> Once you have a bootable USB stick/SD card or DVD with Navigatrix (see &ldquo;<a href="02_getting_nx.html">Getting Navigatrix</a>&rdquo;), installing it to your harddisk is straight forward. You can install Navigatrix alongside your current operating system, choosing between Navigatrix and your current system when you boot your computer. </p>

 <p> First, boot Navigatrix from your USB stick/SD card. You may have to press some function key while the computer starts up in order to tell it to boot from a USB device rather than the hard disk. Most computers will display something like &ldquo;Press &lt;F2&gt; to enter setup&rdquo; for a few seconds on the bottom of the screen <span class="emphasis">before</span> the operating system starts booting. Once Navigatrix is up and running you will a screen that looks like this: <p> <p class="centered"> <img src="images/nx_desktop.gif" width="800" height="450" alt="Navigatrix Desktop" /> </p>

 <p> You can use the system as is, running from the USB device. The interface logic is similar to Windows XP or later: You launch applications by clicking on the little Manta symbol in the bottom-left of the screen (see &ldquo;<a href="04_applications.html">The Applications</a>&rdquo; for details on what you will find under the Manta Menu). </p>

 <p> Once you decide to install Navigatrix to your harddisk (it will run and boot much faster compared to the USB stick), double-click on the &ldquo;Harddisk install option&rdquo; in the top-left of the desktop: </p>

 <p class="centered"> <img src="images/hdd_install_on_desktop.gif" width="139" height="306" alt="Harddisk install option on desktop" /> </p>

 <p> This will launch a set-up program that will take you through the installation process. </p>

 <ol>
 <li>The first screen will ask you about the language in which you want to run the installation. Note: this is not the language that Navigatrix will run in once it is installed but simply the langauge for the installation dialogue. </li>
 </ol>

 <ul class="no_bullet"> <li> <img src="images/install_05_01.gif" width="500" height="412" alt="Language for installation procedure" /> </li>
 </ul>

 <ol start="2"> 
     
     <li>Next comes a check whether the pre-requisites for an installation are met on your system. </li>

 <ul class="no_bullet"> 
     <li> <img src="images/install_05_02.gif" width="500" height="467" alt="Installation prerequisites" /> 
     </li>

    <li>Do <strong>not</strong> select the options <span class="menu_item">Download updates while installing</span> and <span class="menu_item">Install this third-party software</span> on this form. These updates are not required for running Navigatrix and they are likely to do more harm than good if selected. In addition to using up potentially scarce network bandwith for the download, an uncontrolled blanket update may lead to individual components of Navigatrix no longer working smoothly together. The versions of the various pieces of software that together make up Navigatrix have been carefully chosen to make these pieces work together and interface with external devices such as GPS, Pactor, and AIS. For software &ldquo;newer&rdquo; often does not mean &ldquo;better&rdquo; when it comes to reliability. If required you can update individual components of the system  after the installation has completed.</li>

    <li>If you are in range of a wireless network you will next be asked whether you want to connect to that network during the installation. For the reason stated above, do <em>not</em> connect to this network during installation (in fact if you have a wired network connection you may want to disconnect it during the installation - just to be on the safe side...).  
    </li>
    <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_03.gif" width="500" height="468" alt="Wirless connection for installation" /> 
        </li>
  </ul>

  <ol start="3">
      <li> Now we get into the thick of things, defining how and where Navigatrix is to be installed.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="no_bullet">
        
        <li id="installation_type">
        <img src="images/install_05_04.gif" width="500" height="461" alt="Installation type" /> 
        </li>
        
        <li>The easiest case is to have the set-up program wipe your hard drive and install Navigatrix as the only operating system on your computer (option 2 in the image above). However, in most cases you will want to install Navigatrix <em>alongside</em> an existing operating system (e.g. Windows or another Linux distribution) and to choose at each boot which operating system you want to run. This can be done with options 1 and 3 in the image above. Option 1 will automatically create a new partition on your hard drive into which Navigatrix will be installed. Under option 3 you can choose into which existing partition(s) Navigatrix is to be installed. In this case you can also place different branches of the file system into different partitions. For example, you can put the directory tree under <span class="path">/home</span> into a seperate disk partition which makes updating to a new version of Navigatrix in the future easier (you will only have to replace the system files with the new version but keep all your data and configuration files under <span class="path">/home</span>).</li>

        <li><em>Note: If option 1, &ldquo;Install Navigatrix alongside them&rdquo; appears greyed out (inactive) please see <a href="03_installing_nx.html#too_many_primary_partitions">Special Cases</a> at the end of this page.</em>
        </li>
        
        <li>Following we will first describe the installation with the simpler option 1 above. This is sufficient for computers with only one existing operating system. If you already have more than one operating system on your computer and/or you are familiar with setting up and managing partitions on your hard drive you should choose option 3 which will be described further down.
        </li>
        <li>Let's start with option 1, &ldquo;Install Navigatrix alongside them&rdquo;. With this option the only thing you will have to do is to specifiy how much hard disk space you want to dedicate to Navigatrix:
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_05.gif" width="500" height="464" alt="Adjusting partition size" /> 
        </li>
     
     <li>As shown in the image above, you can drag the bar that separates the exisiting hard disk partition from the one to be created for Navigatrix. Moving this bar will adjust the size ratio between the two partitions. If you plan to leave your music, image, and video files on your existing partition, 40-50GB should be a generous allowance for Navigatrix to accommodate charts, email, a digital library, a compressed off-line version of wikipedia, and other application data. If in doubt do a quick sanity check based on your expected requirements. The Navigatrix operating system (including pre-installed applications) will occupy about 6GB, leaving the remainder of the partition for user data (incl. charts, email, etc.) and additional applications you may want to install. You will be able to access files in an exsiting Windows partition from Navigatrix but not the other way around - you won't be able to access files stored in the new Navigatrix partition from Windows.
     </li>

     <li>Under option 1, &ldquo;Install Navigatrix alongside them&rdquo;, this all you will have to do here and you can continue with <a href="03_installing_nx.html#keyboard_layout">step 4</a> below. If you chose option 3, &ldquo;Something else&rdquo; above there are a few more things to do.</li>

        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_06.gif" width="500" height="461" alt="Installing as something else" /> 
        </li>

        <li>If you want to go down this road it is best to set up the required partitions <em>before</em> you start the installation procedure. You can use GParted which comes with Navigatrix (available under <span class="menu_item">Manta menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Partition Editor</span>). We assume that someone choosing option 3 will be familiar with these tools. Alternatively, you can refer to GParted's comprehensive &ldquo;Help&rdquo; documentation and <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1458#p1458">this post</a> on the Navigatrix Support Discussion Board provides some good pointers as well.  
     </li>

     <li>A typical Navigatrix installation under option 3 may use three partitions:</li>
    <ol>
        <li class="lcro">One partition of about 10GB to accommodate the operating system and pre-installed applications. This includes some reserve in case you later choose to install additional applications. Choose &ldquo;ext4&rdquo; as the file system for this partition.
        </li>
        <li class="lcro">A swap partition to which memory operations can be off-shored if your computer runs out of RAM. Setting up this partition is only required if you don't already have an existing linux-swap partition on your har disk (will be visible as such in GParted). 4GB for this swap-partition should be a generous allowance.
        </li>
        <li>The remaining available hard disk capacity can be used for a partition for the <span class="path">home</span> directory in which user files and user specific configuration data will be stored. This partition should also be set up as an &ldquo;ext4&rdquo; file system.
    </ol>

    <li><em>Note: Most PC-type computers will only allow a maximum of four <em>primary</em> partitions on a hard drive. You can get around this limitation by setting the fourth partition up as an <em>extended</em> partition which can then house many more logical partitions. See <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1458#p1458">this post</a> on the Navigatrix Support Discussion Board for some practical pointers.</p>
    </em></li>

    <li>Separating the <span class="path">home</span> directory from the rest of the system as described above will come in handy if you ever want to upgrade to a new version of Navigatrix in the future. You will then only have to drop the new system into the first of the three partitions listed above while retaining all your user and configuration files under <span class="path">home</span> in a separate partition. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Once you have set up the required partitions and selected <span class="menu_item">Something else</span> in the form above, you will see the following dialogue:
    </li>

        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_07.gif" width="500" height="484" alt="Installation type details 1/3" /> 
        </li>

     <li>Here you define into which partition(s) the various pieces of the system should be installed. Pick the relevant partition under &ldquo;Device&rdquo; and click on the <span class="menu_item">Change...</span> button below the device listing. This will open another dialogue window in which you can define the settings for each partition:
     </li>

        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_08.gif" width="500" height="484" alt="Installation type details 2/3" /> 
        </li>

     <li>If the partitions were already set up and sized correctly, you can leave the size unchanged. Just click on the <span class="menu_item">Use as</span> drop-down arrow and select <span class="menu_item">Ext4 journaling file system</span>. Selecting the file system type will open another field labeled &ldquo;Mount point&rdquo;.
     </li>
 
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_09.gif" width="500" height="484" alt="Installation type details 3/3" /> 
        </li>

     <li>Click on the drop-down arrow next to the <span class="menu_item">Mount point</span> field and select which branch of the file system should be installed into this partition. Select the root directory (&ldquo;/&rdquo;) for the operating system including pre-installed applications. For your <span class="path">home</span> directory select &ldquo;/home&rdquo;. If required you can also choose to format these partitions. Don't format a <span class="path">home</span> partition that has data you wish to retain!
     </li>

     <li>Once you made your selections you will see a warning that these changes will have to be written to disk before proceeding. Click on <span class="menu_item">Continue</span>. Once you're done with specifying your desired set-up click on <span class="menu_item">Install now</span>.
     </li>

 </ul>


 <ol start="4"> <li id="keyboard_layout"> Next, you will be asked about your keyboard layout. Test that your choice works correctly by typing a few special characters in the box at the bottom of the screen. This is important as you will later be asked to choose a password. If you enter your choice of password with the installer assuming a different keyboard layout, you may not be able re-create the password later. </li>
 </ol>

    <ul class="no_bullet">
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_10.gif" width="500" height="483" alt="Selecting a keyboard layout" /> 
        </li>
    </ul>

 <ol start="5"> <li> A question about your location is next in order to set time zone and number/date formats correctly (you can change these later under <span class="menu_item">Manta -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Time and Date</span> and <span class="menu_item">Manta -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Language Support</span>). </li> 
 </ol>

    <ul class="no_bullet">
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_11.gif" width="500" height="487" alt="Picking your location" /> 
        </li>
    </ul>

 <ol start="6" id="install_password"> <li> Next, you will be asked to choose a user name and password. </li>
 </ol>

    <ul class="no_bullet">
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_12.gif" width="450" height="437" alt="Picking user name and password" /> 
        </li>

 <li> It is important to remember the password that you enter in this step (even if you choose &ldquo;Log in automatically&rdquo;). There are some operations on a Unix/Linux system that will require you to authenticate yourself as &ldquo;root&rdquo; user (think &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; in Windows Vista and later versions) and will ask for this password (for example, when you want to install additional software). </li>
 </ul>
 
 <ol start="7"> 
     <li> That's all. Once you clicked &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; on the previous form the installer will do it's magic - which may take a moment or two. Once it's done you'll see a confirmation message. </li>
 </ol>

    <ul class="no_bullet">
        <li>
        <img src="images/install_05_13.gif" width="350" height="86" alt="Installation complete" /> 
        </li>

        <li> Note: If you want to start Navigatrix from your hard disk right away, first shutdown with your USB stick/SD card still plugged in. Unplug the device once the computer has shutdown, and then restart it from the harddsik. If you click &ldquo;Restart&rdquo; in the previous dialogue you may mess up the file system on your USB stick/SD card if you unplug it while your computer is still running Navigatrix off it. 
        </li> 
 </ul>
 <p>The next time you boot from your harddisk you should see the boot loader displaying a selection menu that allows you to choose which operating system you want to boot (Navigatrix or whatever you were running up to now). See <a href="03_installing_nx.html#grub_trouble">here</a> if the boot loader fails to display your old operating system as a choice.</p>
 <p> Enjoy! </p>

 <h3>Changing the Default Language for Navigatrix</h3>

 <p>After you have installed Navigatrix on your hard disk you can change the default language for the user interface by following the instructions in <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1835#p1835">this post</a> on the Navigatrix Support Discussion Board. Version 0.5 of Navigatrix already comes complete with English, Spanish, French and -as of September 2013- German language packs.  For these languages you won't have to download any additional packages and can simply re-arrange the preference order for the languages as described in the Discussion Board post. For other languages you will have to download the relevant langauge packages (dictionaries, thesaurus, ...) first (also decribed in the Discussion Board post).</p>

 <h3>Notes on Special Cases</h3>
 <h4 id="too_many_primary_partitions">Installer does not offer "side by side" installation of Navigatrix alongside an existing operating system</h4>
 <p> Depending on how your harddisk has been partitioned prior to isntalling Navigatrix you may not see the "Install them side by side" option in step 4 above. On "traditional" harddisks used for Windows-equipped computers, the partition scheme only allows a maximum of four so called &ldquo;primary partitions&rdquo;. If your harddisk already has four partitions then the Navigatrix installer will be unable to create another partition for Navigatrix. In this case the dialogue above would look like this (note that the screenshot below is still from the 0.4 version of Navigatrix but the essence hasn't changed with version 0.5):</p>

 <p class="centered"><img src="images/4primaryParts.gif" width="400" height="370" alt="Step 4/7 with four existing primary partitions" /></p>

 <p> If you select &ldquo;Specify partitions manually (advanced)&rdquo; in the window above you can actually see the four partitions listed as in the example below:</p>

 <p class="centered"><img src="images/4primaryParts_detail.gif" width="400" height="371" alt="Step 5/8 with four existing primary partitions" /></p>

<p>In this case quit the installation process. You will have to re-shuffle your partitions prior to installing Navigatrix in order to get around the four partition limitation. The way to do this is to first delete the last of the existing primary partitions (after backing up all the data from that partition to restore it later). In its place you then create what is called an "extended partition". This extended partition is simply a container in which you can fit additional partitions as needed. From "the outside" it still looks like four partitions - in line with the maximum - but with one of them (the "extended" one) being able to house additional partitions, you can in effect get around the four-partition limit.</p>

<p>This may sound complicated but is in fact pretty straight forward if you work carefully and make sure you have backed up the data from any partitions you change during this process. Navigatrix comes with a tool that allows you to delete, resize, move and create partitions on you harddisk. You can find it in the Manta Menu under <span class="menu_item">Preferences-&gt;Partition Editor</span>:</p>

 <p class="centered"><img src="images/gparted_in_manta_menu.gif" width="300" height="452" alt="GParted in Manta Menu" /></p>

 <p>Also check out <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1458#p1458">this post</a> on the Navigatrix Support Discussion Board for more info and some practical pointers.</p>
 <!-- TODO: add more detailed instructions for re-partitioning -->


 <h4 id="grub_trouble">GRUB Boot Manager does not show Windows option in boot selection menu</h4>
 <p>When you install Navigatrix alongside Windows (choosing option 1, &ldquo;Install Navigatrix alongside&rdquo; in <a href="03_installing_nx.html#installation_type">step 3</a> above) it will also install &ldquo;GRUB&rdquo; the &ldquo;Grand Unified Boot Loader/Manager&rdquo;. GRUB installs itself into your systems &ldquo;Master Boot Record&rdquo; (or it's UEFI/GPT equivalent if you have a new computer that shipped with Windows 8). When your computer now boots it launches GRUB rather than an operating system. GRUB then asks you which operating system you actually want to boot (Windows or Navigatrix) and launches the operating system of your choice.</p>

 <p> There have been cases where - once you reboot your computer after installing Navigatrix - GRUB only shows a single entry for Navigatrix as a boot option and entry for Windows. Should you encounter this issue it can easily be fixed via the GRUB Customizer which is available (with installation instructions) here: <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1200#p1200">http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?p=1200#p1200</a>. Download the package, install it under Navigatrix on your harddrive, and then launch it from the Manta Menu under <span class="menu_item">Preferences-&gt;Grub Customizer</span>.</p>

 <p class="centered"><img src="images/grub_customizer_in_manta_menu.gif" width="300" height="470" alt="GRUB Customizer in Manta Menu" /></p>

 <p>To launch the GRUB Customizer you will have to enter the password which you <a href="03_installing_nx.html#install_password">set up during the installation</a>. Once the GRUB Customizer is up, it will automatically scan your harddisk for bootable operating systems. When that is completed it should show entries for Navigatrix and Windows (plus some other stuff like &ldquo;memtest&rdquo; which you can ignore at this point). Simply press &ldquo;Save&rdquo; and exit the GRUB Customizer. The next time you boot, the GRUB selection menu should give you a choice between Navigatrix and Windows.</p>

 <li> By default the installer will split space between your old operating system and Navigatrix roughly 50:50 (depending on available free disk space). In the screenshot above that split was adjusted to give Navigatrix 20GB and leaving Windows with about 230GB. If you plan to use Navigatrix primarily for navigation (including storage of your charts), email (Airmail plus some shorebased account), weather data, and documents, but leave photos, videos and music files on your existing (Windows) partition, 20-30GB should give you plenty of space. You can also access your Windows files from Navigatrix in case it ends up being your &ldquo;primary system&rdquo; (as often seems to be the case...). </li>
 <li> If you are in the mood for a bit of an adventure you can go for the &ldquo;Specify partitions manually (advanced)&rdquo; option in this step. This would allow you, for example, to put your &ldquo;home&rdquo; directory (think Windows &ldquo;Documents and Settings&rdquo;) on a separate partition which would later allow you to change to a new version of Navigatrix without the files in your&ldquo;home&rdquo; directory being affected (see <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=261">http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=261</a> in the Navigatrix Support Discussion database).

You can always back up the files in your &ldquo;home&rdquo; directory in case you change to a newer version of Navigatrix at some point in the future (and: one of the nice things about Navigatrix is that you usually don't worry about upgrading). Clicking &ldquo;Forward&rdquo; with this option selected will show you the confirmation screen below. </li>

 <h4>Installer does not offer "side by side" installation of Navigatrix alongside an existing operating system</h4>
 <p> Depending on how your harddisk has been partitioned prior to isntalling Navigatrix you may not see the "Install them side by side" option in step 4 above. On "traditional" harddisks used for Windows-equipped computers, the partition scheme only allows a maximum of four so called &ldquo;primary partitions&rdquo;. If your harddisk already has four partitions then the Navigatrix installer will be unable to create another partition for Navigatrix. In this case the dialogue above would look like this:</p>
d213 2

 <h4>GRUB Boot Manager does not show Windows option in boot selection menu</h4>
 <p>When you install Navigatrix alongside Windows (choosing the &ldquo;side by side&rdquo; option in step 4 above) it will also install &ldquo;GRUB&rdquo; the &ldquo;Grand Unified Boot Loader/Manager&rdquo;. GRUB installs itself into your systems &ldquo;Master Boot Record&rdquo; (assuming you do not have new UEFI/GPT hardware - see below). When your computer now boots it launches GRUB rather than an operating system. GRUB then asks you which operating system you actually want to boot (Windows or Navigatrix) and launches the operating system of your choice.</p>
a222 17
 <h4>Navigatrix failing to boot on new hardware (2011+)</h4>

 <p>Starting in 2011, an increasing portion of new computers are shipped with a &ldquo;next generation BIOS&rdquo; called &ldquo;UEFI&rdquo;, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. Originally introduced by Intel as EFI, UEFI is simply a newer version of EFI and you see the two abbreviations used interchangeably. Among other things, the boot process under EFI is different from traditional BIOS booting. EFI hardware may therefore refuse to boot the current version of Navigatrix from a USB stick (the same applies to Windows version prior to Windows 7). If your computer does run under EFI you should see the term &ldquo;UEFI&rdquo; somewhere in your hardware's boot menu. You can typically enter this menu by pressing &lt;F2&gt;,  &lt;F12&gt; or some other function key which is usually displayed at the bottom of your screen immediately after switching the power in your computer on.</p>

 <p>As most new things, EFI causes some transition pain. If your computer does indeed boot under UEFI, the options you have for running and/or installing Navigatrix depend on a number of things:</p>

 <ol>
     <li>Even if your hardware boot menu shows UEFI entries, it may still run in traditional BIOS mode by default. To actually run under UEFI, the computer's motherboard most be UEFI equipped but also the harddrive must be set up according to a new GPT standard (&ldquo;GUID Partition Table&rdquo;). There are computers (typically factory equipped with Windows 7) that ship with an UEFI motherboard but have &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; harddrives. While these computers will be able to boot under UEFI (if you connect them to a GPT harddisk with a bootable system), by default they will run in BIOS mode from the local harddisk. On these computers you should be able to run and install Navigatrix without any trouble (or - if you have trouble - it is likely not related to UEFI).</li>

     <li>If you have a computer with an UEFI motherboard and a GPT harddisk things get more complicated. The computer's boot menu should allow you to boot from a USB stick in &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; (i.e. BIOS) mode. This will enable you to at least run Navigatrix from a USB device. There may be in option to install Navigatrix on the harddisk, but this will require some manual intervention and tinkering (see this post in the Navigatrix Support discussion database: <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=358">http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=358"</a>)</li>

     <li>Any computer that comes factory equipped with Windows 8 will not only have an UEFI motherboard plus GPT harddisk but it will also feature Microsoft's so called &ldquo;Secure Boot&rdquo;. In essence this will let the computer only boot operating systems (or auxiliary boot loaders) for which a cryptographic key has been registered in the motherboard's permanent memory. In principle this will prevent you from booting Navigatrix or any other &ldquo;mature&rdquo; operating system (even from a USB stick). However, if your computer came equipped with an Intel processor you should be able to switch the Secure Boot feature off somewhere in the boot menu. In that case you're in the same boat as the folks under (2) above. On ARM motherboards you are not that lucky because Microsoft (at least at some point) stipulated that on this hardware it must not be possible to disable the Secure Boot feature.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>If you find yourself out of luck based on the options above you could either...</p>
 <ul> 
     <li>...get some cheap (used) older computer to run Navigatrix from. Navigatrix performs surprisingly well on older/minimal hardware (actually makes you wonder why we keep buying bigger/faster/more expensive computers every few years just to perform essentially the same tasks that we used them for 10 years ago...) and you may (or may not) like the idea of some cheap backup hardware on your boat. Or you could simply...</li>
a223 1
     <li>...wait. There is work underway on Navigatrix to have it run on a linux kernel that is able to run under EFI/GPT and is certified by Microsoft in order to be able to run under its Secure Boot scheme. No promises though - remember that Navigatrix is a volunteer/community effort that relies on donations to keep it going.</li>

   <h1 id="sec_installing_nx">Installing Navigatrix</h1>

<p>
Once you have a bootable USB stick/SD card or DVD with Navigatrix (see &ldquo;<a href="02_getting_nx.html">Getting Navigatrix</a>&rdquo;) installing it to your harddisk is straight forward. You can install Navigatrix alongside your current operating system, choosing between Navigatrix and your current system when you boot your computer.
</p>
<p>
First, boot Navigatrix from your USB stick/SD card. You may have to press some function key while the computer starts up in order to tell it to boot from a USB device rather than the hard disk. Most computers will display something like &ldquo;Press &lt;F2&gt; to enter setup&rdquo; on the bottom of the screen <span class="emphasis">before</span> the operating system starts booting. Once Navigatrix is up and running you will a screen that looks like this:
<p>
<p class="centered">
<img src="images/nx_desktop.gif" width="800" height="450" alt="Navigatrix Desktop" />
</p>

<p>
You can use the system as is, running from the USB device. The interface logic is similar to Windows XP or later: You launch applications by clicking on the little Manta symbol in the bottom-left of the screen (see &ldquo;<a href="04_applications.html">The Applications</a>&rdquo; for details on what you will find under the Manta Menu).
</p>
<p>
Once you decide to install Navigatrix to your harddisk (it will run and boot much faster compared to the USB stick), double-click on the &ldquo;Harddisk install option&rdquo; in the top-left of the desktop:
</p>
<p class="centered">
<img src="images/hdd_install_on_desktop.gif" width="139" height="306" alt="Harddisk install option on desktop" />
</p> 
<p>
This will launch an installation program that will take you through seven steps and ask a few questions along the way. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>The first screen will ask you about the language in which you want to run the installation. Note: this is not the language that Navigatrix will run in once it is installed but simply the langauge for the installation dialogue. 
</li>
</ol>
<ul class="no_bullet">
<li>
<img src="images/install_01.gif" width="400" height="373" alt="Installation step 1/7" />
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Next, you will be asked about your location in order to set time zone and number/date formats correctly (you can change these later under <span class="menu_item">Manta -> Preferences -> Time and Date</span> and <span class="menu_item">Manta -> Preferences -> Language Support</span>).
</li>
</ol>
<ul class="no_bullet">
<li>
<img src="images/install_02.gif" width="400" height="373" alt="Installation step 2/7" />
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
Your keyboard layout is next. Test that your choice works correctly by typing a few special characters in the box at the bottom of the screen. This is important as you will later be asked to choose a password. If you enter your choice of password with the installer assuming a different keyboard layout, you may not be able re-create the password later.

Assuming that you want to run it alongside your current operating system (which in the screenshot below was Windows XP), choose &ldquo;Install them side by side, choosing between each at startup&rdquo;. This will leave your existing system and files untouched, and install Navigatrix as an additional operating system on a free portion of your harddisk. In addition to installing Navigatrix, it will also put a &ldquo;boot loader&rdquo; on your harddisk which will allow you to choose which operating system you want to use each time you boot up your computer.

By default the installer will split space between your old operating system and Navigatrix roughly 50:50 (depending on available free disk space).

</li>
<li>
For the sake of this &ldquo;Short Introduction&rdquo; we assume that you stick with the &ldquo;Install them side by side&rdquo; option. You can always back up the files in your &ldquo;home&rdquo; directory in case you change to a newer version of Navigatrix at some point in the future (and: one of the nice things about Navigatrix is that you usually don't worry about upgrading). Clicking &ldquo;Forward&rdquo; with this option selected will show you the confirmation screen below.
</li>
<li>
<img src="images/install_04a.gif" width="400" height="389" alt="Installation step 4/7 - confirmation" />
</li>
<li>
Go ahead and press &ldquo;Continue&rdquo;. That message box wasn't lying - it may indeed take a long time until you see the next screen (depending on disk size and complexity of the partitions). Let it run its course and don't interrupt it.

</li>
<li>
It is important to remember the password that you enter in this step (even if you choose &ldquo;Log in automatically&rdquo;). There are some operations on a Unix/Linux system that will require you to authenticate yourself as &ldquo;root&rdquo; user (think &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; in Windows Vista and later versions) and will ask for this password (for example, when you want to install additional software).

This will leave your existing system and files untouched, and install Navigatrix as an additional operating system on a free portion of your harddisk. In addition to installing Navigatrix, it will also put a &ldquo;boot loader&rdquo; on your harddisk which will allow you to choose which operating system you want to use each time you boot up your computer. At the bottom of the window you can define how much disk space you want to allocate to Navigatrix by dragging the little slider highlighted by the red circle below.

If you are in the mood for a bit of an adventure you can go for the &ldquo;Specify partitions manually (advanced)&rdquo; option in this step. This would allow you, for example, to put your &lduo;home&rdquo; directory (think Windows &ldquo;Documents and Settings&rdquo;) on a separate partition which would later allow you to change to a new version of Navigatrix without the files in your&ldquo;home&rdquo; directory being affected (see <a href="http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=261">http://navigatrix.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=261</a> in the Navigatrix Support Discussion database). However you should only go down this road if you are comfortable with manually defining partitions and mount points. The screen you would get if you chose that option would look like this:

Once you have a bootable USB stick/SD card or DVD with Navigatrix (see &ldquo;<a href="02_getting_nx.html">Getting Navigatrix</a>&rdquo;) installing it to your hard drive is straight forward:

Once you decide to install Navigatrix to your hard drive (it will run and boot much faster compared to the USB stick), double-click on the &ldquo;Harddisk install option&rdquo; in the top-left of the desktop:

<li>The first screen will ask you about the language in which you want to run the installation. Note: this is not the language that Navigatrix will run in once it is installed but simply the langauge for the installation dialogue. Navigatrix itself is currently available in English, Spanish, and French. These languages can be set #### add info ####

Next, you will be asked about your location in order to set time zone and number/date formats correctly (you can change these later under <span class="menu_item">Manta -> Preferences</span>).
