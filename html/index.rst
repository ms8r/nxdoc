A Short Introduction to Navigatrix

Overview
========

This documents aims to provide a short introduction to Navigatrix, a
Unix- (or, more specifically: Linux-) based operating system and
applications suite developed by cruisers for cruisers. This introduction
will provide you with an overview of the different bits and pieces that
together make up Navigatrix and it will describe how some of these can
be customized and extended.

This document is especially written for people who are familiar with the
way Microsoft Windows works but who had only minimal exposure to
Unix-based platforms. You can use Navigatrix without any knowledge of
Linux/Unix. If you are familiar with Microsoft Windows you should easily
be able to draw the analogies required to understand this document,
which does not provide any basic Unix tutorial. If you are interested in
getting a better understanding of Unix, there a few good introductory
tutorials on the web. A list with links to tutorials can be found under
`http://www.unix.com/answers-frequently-asked-questions/13774-unix-tutorials-programming-tutorials-shell-scripting-tutorials.html <http://www.unix.com/answers-frequently-asked-questions/13774-unix-tutorials-programming-tutorials-shell-scripting-tutorials.html>`__.

Typographic conventions used in this text:

-  Menu entries are set in italics (as is emphasized text but the
   difference should be obvious from the context)
-  Path/file names are set in bold face (as are leading labels in lists
   but the difference should be obvious again from the context)
-  Code and quoted script files are set in monospace
-  Keyboard shortcuts are set in monospace with individual keys enclosed
   in square brackets and simultaneous pressing of key denoted by “+”.
   For example, [ctrl]+[alt]+[T] means pressing the three keys “ctrl”,
   “alt”, and the letter “T” simultaneously (which launches a Terminal
   window).
